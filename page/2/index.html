    <p><img src="/uploads/2022-07/nodetiles.png" alt="NodeTiles' trippy demo image that says &quot;NODTILES&quot; written across a map ofthe globe" /></p>

<p><em>I recently lost access to my 10-year old Code for America email address when I changed jobs. I tried to preserve some of the good stuff and this is one story.</em></p>

<p>During my time as a Code for America Fellow in 2012, I created a Javascript-based slippy map tile renderer called <a href="https://github.com/nodetiles/nodetiles-core">NodeTiles</a> (kinda sorta like Mapnik). Several colleagues helped vastly expand it, we presented at NACIS, and I know of at least one successful company that is still powered by forked version of it today.</p>

<p><strong>Jessica</strong></p>

<p>During our Fellowship, Jessica Lord gave a tech talk on building custom map tiles and first introduced me to TileMill. I couldn‚Äôt find a record in my email of when that happened, but know she planted this seed üå±</p>

<p><strong>Tom</strong></p>

<p>On April 25, 2012, I sent this email to Tom Carden:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This week I came across a gist of yours and eventually made my way to nodemap while researching how to generate server-side map tiles. Thank you so much for putting those pieces together; they‚Äôre fantastic! I matched your code with node-canvas-heroku to get it running in the cloud and it‚Äôs pretty fantastic:</p>

  <p><a href="http://morning-spring-2292.herokuapp.com/">http://morning-spring-2292.herokuapp.com/</a></p>

  <p>Anyways, just wanted to send you a big thanks for the code and inspiration. I‚Äôm working on building a node-based utfgrid renderer to bootstrap an entire wax interaction layer‚Ä¶ all without Mapnik (though maybe I should just work on packaging that for Heroku).</p>

  <p>Cheers,
Ben</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tom gave some helpful advice and caveat emptor about JS performance and data caching. He continued to follow up with node-canvas and cairo suggestions for getting stuff running on Heroku. Tom ended up being a Code for America mentor for a different project and he was the source of us using the Toner map style in demos and also a nice leaflet clustering plugin.</p>

<p><strong>Rob</strong></p>

<p>Rob Brackett was the first person I explained what I was doing to create a tile render in Javascript. His reaction to my explanation was ‚ÄúWhat the fuck are you talking about?‚Äù Rob is one of my best friends, and I don‚Äôt remember how I explained what would become Nodeiles initially, but I‚Äôm sure it took 20 minutes and was a non-linear train of thought.</p>

<p>On May 2, 2012, I sent this email to ‚ÄúFuzz‚Äù, Code for America‚Äôs random-nerdsnipe list:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>Last week Rob and I built a heroku-compatible map-tile renderer (and UTFGrid generator)¬†that can quickly (and with low bandwidth/client-processing) serve¬†interactive maps and markers comprising tens of thousands of points¬†and polygons‚Äîand unlike TileMill, the final map can be connected to¬†a live database and updated on-the-fly. It‚Äôs kind‚Äôve badass.</p>

  <p>Here are 2 examples:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Static map of San Francisco streets and Parks:¬†
 <a href="http://morning-spring-2292.herokuapp.com/">http://morning-spring-2292.herokuapp.com/</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Map of all ~1.5k Occupy sites worldwide (I did this in about 15min, so it‚Äôs a little clunky):
 <a href="http://occupy-map.herokuapp.com/">http://occupy-map.herokuapp.com/</a></p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>In terms of why it‚Äôs badass (from less to more geeky):</p>

  <ol>
    <li>It‚Äôs fast. Nothing is rendered in the browser, instead all of the tiles are rendered and streamed to the browser as PNGs.</li>
    <li>It‚Äôs small. No shapefiles are sent to the browser. Each Map (the entire initial pageload) is less than 500kb.</li>
    <li>It can do dynamic data. TileMill makes beautiful maps, but once you export them to MapBox (or your own mbtile server), you can‚Äôt change them. This can be hooked up to a live database (right now it parses geojson).</li>
    <li>It runs on Heroku. It uses node-canvas (not Mapnik) so it is fast, lightweight and has few dependencies.</li>
    <li>It renders UTFGrids, which can provide mouse-hovers and other straightforward UI stuff that most maps don‚Äôt (way less clicky)</li>
    <li>It‚Äôs not a tileserver, it‚Äôs a tile <em>renderer</em>. Seriously, all those maptiles are being generated on on-the-fly (we should probably cache them, but hey, this is bleeding edge)</li>
    <li>It‚Äôs nodejs and all the code is on Github:¬† <a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/nodetiles">https://github.com/bensheldon/nodetiles</a> ¬†</li>
  </ol>

  <p>I‚Äôm still working on it, so if you have a big dataset that you‚Äôve had trouble mapping before, let me know since I‚Äôm looking for more/better use cases.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Prashant</strong></p>

<p>Prashant Singh, another Code for America fellow, was excited about the project and gave me lots of feedback. Prashant was using my project to generate large static maps from the commandline, and he gave some feedback on his experience doing similar work with Mapnik. Prashant and two other Fellows, Alicia Rouault and Matt Hampel, would subsequently build a business on top of it.</p>

<p>On June 5, 2012 I sent this email to Eric Gundersen at Mapbox:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>I haven‚Äôt done a big writeup yet. I‚Äôm hoping to submit to NACIS for their October conference, but I‚Äôm still trying to clean up the code, modularize it, and write tests and documentation.</p>

  <p>General backstory: I had been playing around a lot with TileMill and Mapnik and trying to programmatically generate map tiles; at CfA we have a lot of big, dynamic data and I was trying to set up an automated tile renderer. Then I came across a Tom Carden project where he was use Node-Canvas to render tiles‚Ä¶ and then I discovered a node-canvas module that would run on Heroku‚Ä¶ and by that point I was in love with the idea of a low-dependency (compared to mapnik) on-the-fly tile rendering implementation.</p>

  <p>From there, I wanted to see how close I could get to a full-blown TileJSON implementation. I had my coworker Rob Brackett write me a Javascript UTFGrid implementation and I hooked that up to the tile rasterizer. And bam. It‚Äôs clunky as hell, and sort‚Äôve slow (it‚Äôs rendering an entire shapefile then cropping it down for every tile rather than spatially indexing the features), but I think it has potential.¬†</p>

  <p>I think the next step (in addition to cleanup and documentation) is loading up some OSM metro data and actually seeing how the performance compares to Mapnik. Also, while I can‚Äôt foresee implementing something like Cascadenik, node-canvas gives you direct access to the graphics renderer and it might be useful for creating boutique maps with graphical flourishes that Mapnik hasn‚Äôt implemented‚Ä¶ and of course for creating layers with dynamic data.</p>

  <p>Let me know if you have any specific questions or ideas you‚Äôd like me to try to implement or use as demos. Thanks for the interest!</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Alex</strong></p>

<p>Alex Yule, another Code for America Fellow, and an actual experienced cartographer, was also interested. Alex would build a proper database adapter layer and the actual spatial indexing functionality that all of my previous emails yolo. Alex joined Rob and my presentation proposal at NACIS. This was our abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NodeTiles: Joyful Map Tile Rendering with Node.js</strong></p>

  <p>Mapnik has become the de facto open-source standard for rendering map tiles. While Mapnik is extremely powerful, it can be difficult to set up and deploy. We present NodeTiles, a lightweight, JavaScript-based, open-source map tile renderer that is easy to deploy, use, and extend. Built to support applications with dynamic data, NodeTiles offers an accessible and cloud-friendly alternative to Mapnik. While still in early-stage development, features on the road-map include styling with the CSS-based Carto language for compatibility with MapBox TileMill, UTFGrid generation for client-side interactivity, and data adaptors for PostGIS and Shapefiles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>NACIS</strong></p>

<p>The NACIS (North American Cartographic Information Society) conference was October 17-19, 2012 in Portland, Oregon. Alex and Rob and I had gotten an AirBnB and I mostly remember us doing a lot of last-minute implementing. Alex built a really nice Postgres Adapter plugin and Rob was reimplementing Cascadenik (‚ÄúCSS for Maps‚Äù) somewhere between Javascript and Cairo; there was a deep-dive into blitting. We presented at a breakout called ‚ÄúSlippy Maps‚Äù.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I remember riding BART back from the airport when we arrived home in San Francisco. I was talking with a maybe-a-big-deal person from the map-tech community, and they asked me something pointed like ‚ÄúBut how much did <strong>you</strong> <em>really</em> contribute to NodeTiles?‚Äù I said something like ‚ÄúIt was a team effort‚Äù and then it got really quiet. In hindsight that was probably a job interview. And also fuck that, it <em>was</em> a team effort.</p>

<p><strong>That‚Äôs it</strong></p>

<p>During Fall of 2012 Code for America Fellowship was ending and interviewing as an inexperienced engineer is freaking hard (and also incredibly dumb, but those are different stories). So I mostly put down NodeTiles. And also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Going from something that‚Äôs a tech demo to something understandable (‚ÄúWhat the fuck are you talking about‚Äù) and usable by outsiders is hard.</li>
  <li>The sheer difficulty of spatial work. That dumb NodeTiles logo took me hours just to get the tooling together to just like, draw straight lines on a globe to say ‚ÄúNODETILES‚Äù.</li>
  <li>Maps are a commodity, and also if you need to dynamically map a billion+ polyons (I‚Äôve been informed that today there is Postgres MVT) <em>and</em> you need a pipeline for auth and anti-scrape and billing and raster and‚Ä¶. well, god bless you.</li>
  <li>I leaned into some questionable architectural decisions to make NodeTiles more Javascripty, splitting up the front and backends, and modularizing all the different pieces into their own packages. In hindsight that was a lot of valueless work that only introduced friction into building the tool and delivering the value. That‚Äôs on me; never forget.</li>
  <li>Given that this is an email-based retrospective, I will admit I found some emails from kinda big deals like Stamen that I didn‚Äôt respond to. I dunno why I didn‚Äôt respond; probably burnout. If that was you, it wasn‚Äôt personal, and I‚Äôm happy with the path I‚Äôve taken, and I hope you are too ü§ó</li>
</ul>

<p>NodeTiles is <a href="https://github.com/nodetiles">still up on GitHub</a>. If you can get node-canvas linking to cairo (memories of this seems like a fever dream), NodeTiles is really cool. Maybe you‚Äôll do something neat with Nodetiles ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/bensheldon/bridging-people-and-benefits-systems">my presentation of how my small engineering team helped deliver food stamps to millions of Californians</a>, I talked about a common pathology of engineers: a desire to build the equivalent of thousand-year clocks that will run self-contained without human intervention. You see it crop up in different forms, the good ways of ‚Äúworking yourself out of a job‚Äù and the bad ways of platinum plating and astronaut architects.</p>

<p>And I‚Äôve become become aware of that pathology affecting how engineers perceive the labor of <em>other people</em>: they don‚Äôt, not the people part. And that‚Äôs bad.</p>

<p>To be fair, not seeing the people isn‚Äôt just an engineering pathology. We talk about products, and services, and value, and how<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tedchiang/the-real-danger-to-civilization-isnt-ai-its-runaway#.spxyjARZP"> capitalist corporations are simply slow AI</a>. And I‚Äôve been working with a leadership coach and spending a fair bit of time contemplating what it means to do something larger than myself but within the realm of human endeavour.  So please go with me here.</p>

<p>Platforms.  I‚Äôve spent a lot of my career working on X-as-a-Platform. Which is the idea that it‚Äôs a <em>good thing</em> if the things in our lives become analogous to vending machines, or FedEx status pages: we press the button on the machine, and we get what we want, and if not now, then the machine will tell us exactly when.</p>

<p>But this idea of platforms, the machine, break down when the machine‚Ä¶ breaks down, or just changes. When the <em>good</em> sandwich cookies are out, or they get replaced with the <em>bad</em> sandwich cookies, or when there are no sandwich cookies at all because it‚Äôs Tuesday morning and deliveries normally happen on Monday and Monday was a holiday. Then we‚Äôre confronted with a reality: you, and I, and the people who stock the machine, and build the machine, and the people who make the decisions about what to stock it with, or when, and how, and why‚Ä¶.</p>

<p>We are all simply harried, overworked bags of dirty water that are winging it and doing our best balancing conflicting business needs, and complicated lives and health and families and concerns and motivations completely unrelated to the <em>good</em> sandwich cookies and your obtaining them. I‚Äôm sorry.</p>

<p>We can agree: it sure would be nice if the machine had the sandwich cookies you wanted.</p>

<p>Or not: my agreement could also be the pathology talking. The machine is not the human endeavor here‚Ä¶ though my sympathy for your situation (and our shared pathology) could be.</p>

<p>This particular line of thought was triggered by reading this passage from James Bennet‚Äôs <a href="https://www.b-list.org/weblog/2022/jul/11/pypi/">‚ÄúYes, I have opinions on your open source contributions‚Äù</a>  about some drama going on around the situation of the people who run the PyPI Python package repository wanting to add additional security requirements on the people who publish packages to said repository to protect the people who download packages from said repository and thus reduce support demand on said repository maintainers by preventing packages from being compromised (analogus some drama is playing out in my world of Ruby too):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you believe nobody has the right to ‚Äùdemand‚Äù an open-source maintainer do something or abide by some policy or restriction, then that ends the argument in more ways than people are appreciating. If you just want to say ‚Äúnobody can demand I do this‚Äù, then OK, but you also can‚Äôt demand PyPI ‚Äî which is an open-source project, too ‚Äî do any particular thing or abide by any particular policy you‚Äôd like, which more or less removes any grounds you might have had to criticize their account security approach. They don‚Äôt owe you anything and don‚Äôt have to do what you want them to do, the end.</p>

  <p>But a lot of people in comment threads are trying really hard to figure out a way to impose requirements and standards on PyPI‚Äôs maintainers but not on anyone else, which then contradicts the ‚Äúit‚Äôs open-source, you can‚Äôt demand anyone do anything‚Äù basis of the whole argument. Somewhat amusing are people who try to argue that PyPI has a lot more power to affect people and so should be restricted more, which is an equally good argument for imposing on people who maintain major packages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And there‚Äôs a lot more.</p>

<p>To follow my thread of before, there‚Äôs a lot of demanding going on that the people, who are inseparable from the package repository, be vending machines. And what, to me, sounds like a fair and reasonable counterpoint being that people are not vending machines. And we should go with that.</p>

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Two months! In my last update I wrote about an overwhelming sense of normalcy. That has continued, in a good way.</p>

<p>I am making good pace at completing my Engineering Manager bingo card. So far I have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Worked with team and directors to write out quarterly OKRs, and close out the previous quarters</li>
  <li>Gone through (well, shadowed) the half-yearly performance review process</li>
  <li>Worked with a report through their departure from the team</li>
  <li>Participated in the candidate interview loop, though not yet as a hiring manager</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="something-im-inspired-by">Something I‚Äôm inspired by</h3>

<p>Writing OKRs with my team, boss, grandboss, and peer managers has been really, really, nice.</p>

<ul>
  <li>My team has been open within the OKR writing process, and creative, and participatory. I fumbled a bit trying to design an async but consensus Enthusiasm/Complexity matrix, but it‚Äôs been a great resource for me to understand the backlog and the team‚Äôs interests.</li>
  <li>My boss and grandboss have been understated , but driving the importance of OKRs. I‚Äôve particularly appreciate them say ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get it right, but it‚Äôs also just a Google Doc and we can change it‚Äù</li>
  <li>My peer managers as bar raisers in the process. We write OKRs for the department within the same document and I‚Äôve appreciated getting comments and questions about consistency and measurements and categorizations.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think planning is a fun challenge, with the two things that I focus on being:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Strategic Planning vs Operational Planning. In my sideline as a strategic planning consultant, separating out these threads is <em>the work</em>.</li>
  <li>Team participation. I wasn‚Äôt surprised that participatory OKR planning was a stretch. At my previous jobs it‚Äôs not uncommon to have coworkers go from griping about long participatory planning meetings, to then asking ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand how the team prioritizes work.‚Äù Sometimes that can mean ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt agree with what came out of planning‚Äù but it frequently can mean ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see <em>that</em> planning as the venue for what <em>I</em> want to advocate for.‚Äù</li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôm still uncomfortable writing essays in Slack, but I did write this for the team:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OKR thoughts: It might be interesting to explain how I view the OKRs in case it changes your feedback about them.</p>

  <p>I write OKRs is that they‚Äôre a summary of what the team wants to do, to be communicated upwards. And then we expect management/leadership to protect/fund those activities over the duration of the quarter.</p>

  <p>So they‚Äôre things that we believe (hopefully, feedback wanted) :</p>
  <ul>
    <li>we‚Äôre enthusiastic about doing (most importantly)</li>
    <li>AND we think we can reasonably accomplish during the quarter (maybe with a bit of stretch, but that should come from us)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>And then that gets sent upwards, and (usually, in my experience elsewhere) Leadership says ‚Äúgreat! let us know how we can help.‚Äù And if there is feedback, it‚Äôs usually of the form of ‚Äúdo you think this falls more into X or Y bucket?‚Äù (because they have to write their OKRs) and then maybe it‚Äôs a conversation. I‚Äôve seen Leadership start meddling when a team doesn‚Äôt put forward a confident set of objectives, not usually in opposition to them. They‚Äôre part of a team umbrella ‚òÇÔ∏è</p>

  <p>I have never seen OKRs be inflicted on a team; if it feels that way, I think that sucks. Hence why I‚Äôm wanting to explain my perspective in case that‚Äôs new.</p>

  <p>Bring thoughts to our Sync Meeting next Tuesday, or add them to the OKR chat above, or DM me.</p>

  <p>Thank you for coming to my TED Talk üòÉ</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="something-im-challenged-by">Something I‚Äôm challenged by</h3>

<p>One way you might design a performance review process is to combine:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Evaluative feedback, simple quantitative metrics (does not meet, meets, exceeds) expectations, grounded against a career ladder or functional job description.</li>
  <li>Coaching and appreciation, qualitative narrative about past contributions and future opportunity and explains the gaps between the true work and the ideals of the career ladder.</li>
  <li>Unifying economic model for salary adjustments (and bonus, new to me) and promotions that answers what the company ‚Äúrecognizes‚Äù (‚Äúrecognition‚Äù  is how across my career I hear ICs talk about their perceived match between personal/team contributions and compensation/hierarchy)</li>
</ul>

<p>The challenge of these systems (like my essay on OKRs above) is keeping them simple enough to be transparent, while recognizing that the map is neither the landscape, nor the expedition. I think there is room for improvement in all things, and I haven‚Äôt yet seen any of the worst pathologies of my past (like a long ago director who pushed back against a transparent career ladder because of their fear people would ‚Äúgame it‚Äù). I‚Äôm hoping I remember all this 6 months from now when it kicks off again.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What‚Äôs next</h3>

<p>I get to see how the team executes on our OKRs and how our quarterly engineering rotation kicks off. I‚Äôm excited for both.</p>

    <p>I just had my 1-month anniversary. The new job feels‚Ä¶. normal ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It‚Äôs 1:1s and sensemaking (dot-connecting, aligning, stortytelling) and gently holding and sharing and developing opinions about how people should collaborate in the worksplace and <em>engineering</em> the infrastructure that supports that. I dunno, given that I‚Äôm still working from home, it‚Äôs all still people stuff just different people. One of those <a href="variations within groups are greater than variations between groups">Boasian</a> ‚Äúvariations within groups are greater than variations between groups‚Äù things. People are great!</p>

<h2 id="something-im-inspired-by">Something I‚Äôm inspired by</h2>

<p>I‚Äôve observed a lot of reinforcement of goals and values. I‚Äôve been impressed seeing my team jump on an issue and not just say ‚ÄúI can help‚Äù but also ‚ÄúOur team‚Äôs purpose is to help.‚Äù Or seeing my Director hop in a comment and not just say ‚ÄúGreat work‚Äù but also ‚ÄúThis is a great example of our group‚Äôs charter‚Äù.</p>

<p>I think the majority of the feedback a manager should be giving is shining a spotlight on the things someone is already doing that are good and meaningful, and I‚Äôve been inspired to see that in action from others.</p>

<h2 id="something-im-thinking-about">Something I‚Äôm thinking about</h2>

<p>I‚Äôve been working through Lara Hogan‚Äôs <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/">‚ÄúQuestions for our first 1:1‚Äù</a>, which is part of my personal manager runbook.</p>

<p>The question ‚ÄúHow do you prefer to receive recognition?‚Äù gets spicy answers!  I‚Äôm managing a very high level team and the answers closely line up with my own high-level friends and high-level former coworkers and myself: people are <em>uncomfortable</em> with recognition.</p>

<p>Which is‚Ä¶ a not unreasonable reaction. In the words of a close friend ‚ÄúThis is total shit, but‚Ä¶ thanks, I‚Äôm glad you like it.‚Äù  When I think about my own reaction, I attribute it to navigating a lot of intersecting supremacy cultures (conscious and unconscious) which are complicated: perfectionism, humbleness, <a href="http://transmissionproject.org/current/2011/4/honest-practice-how-the-public-sector-can-look-at-itself-new-article-in-resources.html">honest practice</a>, a desire to recognize all contributors (which has its own recursive sympathy).</p>

<p>I get it. I think about how much self-work I‚Äôve done in my own life to reply to ‚ÄúI like your X‚Äù with simply ‚ÄúThanks!‚Äù (and not ‚Äúoh, and I like your..‚Äù or ‚Äúoh, it‚Äôs not that great‚Äù).</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What‚Äôs next</h2>
<p>Two quarterly activities are upcoming that I‚Äôm excited to be organizing for the first time: engineering rotations and OKR setting. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll learn a lot.</p>

    <p>I started a new job midweek this week at GitHub, managing their Ruby Architecture team. I love the team‚Äôs mission:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Making it easy for our engineers to create, deliver, and operate best-of-class Ruby and Rails applications, and sharing the best of it with the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I also took about 2.5 weeks in between leaving Code for America and starting this job, so I‚Äôm feeling fresh and ready for several weeks of official onboarding, and several months of growing into the role.</p>

<p><strong>Something I learned</strong></p>

<p>GitHub is heavily into written documentation. <a href="https://ben.balter.com/2014/10/07/expose-process-through-urls/">‚ÄúIf it doesn‚Äôt have a URL, it didn‚Äôt happen.‚Äù</a>. And not just cross-referencing, but emoting and emoji-ing, and being, well, <em>extra</em>. Writing and communication has been reinforced <em>a lot</em> during onboarding, more even than the content itself. Which makes sense: if you understand how the organization communicates, you can seek answers independently.</p>

<p><strong>Something I was inspired by</strong></p>

<p>Despite formal onboarding being my number one focus, I‚Äôve been having casual 1:1s with my team. They‚Äôre great! I‚Äôve been inspired by the nuance and understanding they bring to the work. On its own, being a service team is <em>hard</em>, and corporate open source is <em>hard</em>. I‚Äôve found myself heavily nodding along hearing them discuss the challenges of moving people forward. It‚Äôs brought to surface a few thoughts and memories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Of being a frontend lead at Pantheon and the challenges of getting platform-team resources to build up to the outcome and vision we all agreed on, but that had some uncomfortable zigs and zags to get there. A case of make the change easy (which <em>can be hard</em>), then make the easy change.</li>
  <li>My falling out of the Drupal ecosystem as it developed more in line with the needs of full-service agencies than of solo devs and configurers like myself. As one of my colleagues admitted this week, our developers aren‚Äôt running ‚Äúrails new‚Äù a whole lot and that‚Äôs something to be mindful of how it shapes the contributions.</li>
  <li>‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre leading and no one is following, you‚Äôre just out for a walk.‚Äù</li>
</ul>

    <p>From <em>An Astronauts Guide to Planet Earth</em> by Chris Hadfield:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>Feeling ready to do something doesn‚Äôt mean feeling certain you‚Äôll succeed, though of course that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre hoping to do. Truly being ready means understanding what could go wrong ‚Äì and having a plan to deal with it. You could learn to scuba dive in a resort pool, for instance, and go on to have a wonderful first dive in the ocean even if you had no clue how to buddy breathe or what to do if you lost a flipper. But if conditions were less than ideal, you could find yourself in serious danger. In the ocean, things can go wrong in one breath, and the stakes are life and death. That‚Äôs why in order to get a scuba license you have to do a bunch of practice dives and learn how to deal with a whole set of problems and emergencies so that you‚Äôre really ready, not just ready in calm seas.</p>

  <p>For the same sort of reasons, trainers in the space program specialize in devising bad-news scenarios for us to act out, over and over again, in increasingly elaborate simulations. We practice what we‚Äôll do if there‚Äôs engine trouble, a computer meltdown, an explosion. Being forced to confront the prospect of failure head-on ‚Äì to study it, dissect it, tear apart all its components and consequences ‚Äì really works. After a few years of doing that pretty much daily, you‚Äôve forged the strongest possible armor to defend against fear: hard-won competence.</p>

  <p>Our training pushes us to develop a new set of instincts. Instead of reacting to danger with a fight-or-flight adrenaline rush, we‚Äôre trained to respond unemotionally by immediately prioritizing threats and methodically seeking to defuse them. We go from wanting to bolt for the exit to wanting to engage and understand what‚Äôs going wrong, then fix it.</p>

  <p>Early on during my last stay on the ISS, I was jolted to consciousness in the middle of the night: a loud horn was blaring. For a couple of seconds I was in a fog, trying to figure out what that unpleasant noise was. There were four of us in the American section of the Station then, and like prairie dogs, we all poked our heads up out of our sleep pods at the same time to look at the panel of emergency lights on the wall that tell us whether we should be concerned about depressurization, toxicity or some other potential fatal disaster. Suddenly all of us were wide awake. That deafening noise was the fire alarm.</p>

  <p>A fire is one of the most dangerous things that can happen in a spaceship because there‚Äôs nowhere to go; also, flames behave less predictably in weightlessness and are harder to extinguish. In my first year as an astronaut, I think my response to hearing the alarm would have been to grab an extinguisher and start fighting for my life, but over the past 21 years that instinct has been trained in, represented by three words: warn, gather, work.</p>

  <p><strong>‚ÄúWorking the problem‚Äù is NASA-speak for descending one decision tree after another, methodically looking for a solution until you run out of oxygen.</strong> <strong>We practice the ‚Äúwarn, gather, work‚Äù protocol for responding to fire alarms so frequently that it doesn‚Äôt just become second nature; it actually supplants our natural instincts. So when we heard the alarm on the Station, instead of rushing to don masks and arm ourselves with extinguishers, one astronaut calmly got on the intercom to warn that a fire alarm was going off ‚Äì maybe the Russians couldn‚Äôt hear it in their module ‚Äì while another went to the computer to see which smoke detector was going off. No one was moving in a leisurely fashion, but the response was one of focused curiosity; as though we were dealing with an abstract puzzle rather than an imminent threat to our survival. To an observer it might have looked a little bizarre, actually: no agitation, no barked commands, no haste.</strong></p>

  <p>The next step is the gather, so we joined the Russians in their part of the Station to start working on the problem. How serious was the threat? So far, all the signs were reassuring. We couldn‚Äôt smell smoke of see flames. Maybe one little wire had melted somewhere, or the detector was responding to dust. We talked to Mission Control in Houston and in Moscow, but as we investigated, checking the module where the detector had been triggered, it seemed more and more likely that we were dealing with a simple malfunction. Finally, everyone agreed that it had been a false alarm, and we headed back to our sleep stations. An hour later, when the fire alarm sounded again, we repeated the warn, gather, work protocol just as before. The response was similarly calm, though not perfunctory ‚Äì possibly something had been slowly smoldering for the past hour. As it turned out, nothing had. The detector was a lemon, that‚Äôs all. I remember thinking, ‚ÄúThat was a little like a sim, only better, because now I get to sleep.‚Äù</p>

  <p>I doubt anyone‚Äôs heart rate increased by more than a beat or two while we were dealing with those fire alarms, even during the first minutes when the threat of a raging inferno seemed most real. We felt competent to deal with whatever happened ‚Äì a sense of confidence that comes directly from solid preparation. Nothing boosts confidence quite like simulating a disaster, engaging with it fully, both physically and intellectually, and realizing you have the ability to work the problem. Each time you manage to do that your comfort zone expands a little, so if you ever face that particular problem in real life, you‚Äôre able to think clearly.</p>

    <p>From the <a href="https://tymbals.com/splash/metacryptoverse.html">‚ÄúThe MetaCryptoVerse‚Äù</a>, which triggered my oft-observation that civic tech too-frequently regresses to resource directories (lists of services):</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>‚Ä¶what happens when our institutions become just lists. Lists scattered across a network of databases.</p>

  <p>You see we are attune to the idea of data disrupting paper. What we are not attune to is this idea of data disrupting space. Or more accurately how information architecture is disrupting architecture. Banks become lists, manifest as a collection ATMs, PC and smartphones. Office blocks become lists manifest as web pages and mobile apps. Hospitals become lists manifest as patent records and augmented beds. Government agencies become lists manifest as web pages and pdfs. Libraries become Google. Which is to say they become lists. Our clubs and churches or more accurately our communal meeting places become Facebook pages. Which is to say they become lists. Our shops become lists. Be they Amazonian or iTuna. Or schools and colleges become Moocs. Which is to say they become lists.</p>

  <p>Now these are ideas. Conceptual models. Thought experiments. Dare I say TEDs? worth exploring. What happens when our world evolves from the bucket list to a bucket full of lists?</p>

  <p>What would this new architecture look like? How do we interact with these new spaces? And what are the types of games we will be playing to occupy our days? What is it like to live life as an endless fractal narrative? What will be the sum of our days? The sum of experiences in this brave new world? Of life lived as a bucket full of lists. Virtual or otherwise. Just how will these lists shape our behaviour? Regulate our emotions? Facilitate our transaction? Engineer our experiences? Provoke our responses? Design our Desires? Juxtapose our inner tensions? Manipulate our self image? Game our expectations?</p>

  <p>We discovered these are conversations worth having‚Ä¶ with others.</p>

    <p><em>This reflection of my experience on GetCalFresh is dedicated to the memory of Andrew Hyder who taught me a lot about living out and protecting team values every day.</em></p>

<h3 id="plus-we-are-the-team-extreme-programming-are-the-values">Plus: We are the team; Extreme Programming are the values</h3>

<p>We are not the website. From the beginning, there was an opinionated directed emphasis on building healthy team norms and values. These principles and doctrines were from ‚ÄúExtreme Programming Explained‚Äù; the values were legible and strongly reinforced by team leadership. All of the things we have created (websites, text messaging, document processing, research) were outputs not artifacts and never the goal. There was a strong emphasis on ‚ÄúAnd the friends we made along the way.‚Äù</p>

<h3 id="plus-an-experience-of-critical-inspiration">Plus: An experience of critical inspiration</h3>

<p>This was always an exercise in pattern matching what we were trying to achieve in the benefits space to Bay Area tech ecosystem structures and practices. Early debates of products and services, jobs to be done, design principles, disruption (‚Äúmaking the status quo untenable‚Äù), leverage, and the thing itself we were building: a funnel-based, outreach machine that disintermediated the benefits process. It was a practical act of constructive criticism of the tech and tech culture around us that recognized mastery of existing forms before we inevitably depart and transcend them (‚Äúshuhari‚Äù).</p>

<h3 id="plus-incremental-growth-is-a-hell-of-a-drug">Plus: Incremental growth is a hell of a drug</h3>

<p>A growth engine, an ‚Äúengine that eats barriers‚Äù. It demonstrated that a line that went ‚Äúup and to the right‚Äù could itself pay the organizational story tax. While we celebrated partnership wins, there was a focus on growing client outreach unbounded (‚Äúpermissionless‚Äù). As software engineers, we were achieving the Agile principle that working software, in the hands of users, was the primary measure of progress.</p>

<p>58 counties was an incremental goal, that was out of reach but attainable, which made planning and decision making tangible, though not easy. It helped align the team and gave direction to planning out the next steps and necessities.</p>

<h3 id="delta-maintain-client-success-as-the-centerpole-during-growth">Delta: Maintain Client Success as the centerpole during growth</h3>

<p>I think of ‚Äúscaling‚Äù entailing both size and health. Early on, ‚ÄúClient Success‚Äù was the unifying intention of everyone (‚Äúclose the participation gap‚Äù). Everyone was exhorted to use their whole selves to help clients receive benefits. I remember being mindblowingly told ‚Äúyou have their phone number, call them‚Äù when I observed clients hit technical or process barriers; I did, again and again. Technology was in the truest sense an extension of our embodied capacity to help.</p>

<p>As time went on the client success function became less of a critical inspiration, and instead came to feel closer to the status quo: handling the overwhelming externalities of the service, rather than the service being the multiplier of our puny human abilities. I feel a responsibility to help balance ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt need to help ourselves‚Äù with ‚Äúput on your oxygen mask before helping others‚Äù; and ‚Äúleave a seam‚Äù with ‚Äúa stitch in time saves nine‚Äù.</p>

<p>And ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù felt narrowed with a refocusing towards ‚ÄúSystems Change‚Äù and the subjectless ‚ÄúBuild with‚Äù. My desires for lighting escalation paths (‚Äúclick here to talk to a supervisor; a director; your state representative; the FBI‚Äù), and consciousness-raising (‚Äú20k people in your county also had their benefits denied this month too‚Äù) remain unfulfilled.</p>

<h3 id="plus-small-teams-can-do-big-things">Plus: Small teams can do big things</h3>

<p>From me starting as the first outside hire, to me rolling off the team, we helped more than 8M people receive $5.3B in benefits. And the team continues on without me: I feel missed, unnecessary, and proud of both. Small, directed (North Star: ‚Äúclose the participation gap‚Äù; Mission: ‚Äúuse the principles and practices of the digital age to improve how the government serves the American public <em>and how the public improves government</em>‚Äù) teams, can do things together that far exceed the capacity of any one individual, and also outperform teams multiples of their size. It has been an amazing journey.</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>U.S. military advisers are taught to prioritize their relationships with their counterparts, as ‚Äútrust and confidence define how well the advisor will be able to influence the foreign security force.‚Äù</p>

  <p>Many U.S. military advisers come to view interpersonal rapport with partners‚Äîonce a tool presumed to increase influence and shape partner behavior‚Äîas the very goal of advising. When persuasion fails, advisers are instructed to avoid any steps that might jeopardize the relationship.</p>

  <p>‚Ä¶The military is aiming to minimize bureaucratic headache and implement the standard operating procedures it can sustain, even if those procedures are untethered from its own theory of victory.</p>
