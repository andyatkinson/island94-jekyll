<p>Spring came a lot earlier to Washington, DC than it did to New England, but the mercury is topping 80 today in Boston. Above, I’m at the Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington, DC last month. Below is the one of the multitudinous dandelions that have sprung up around UMass Boston.</p>

          <p><em>Wrote this a while back and it’s been floating around my drafts pile. The story is a little light, but mostly I wrote it to remember all the arcane details my landlord’s handyman told me when he came to rehang our doors.</em></p>

<p>Monday morning; my girl was out of town on business. Her business. I was watching the Price is Right: dolts with nothing better to do with their time either. One knocked at my door.</p>

<p>I wiped the spent food refuse and old files towards the far end of my desk. The desk is a large one and sometimes that’s needed. Today it wasn’t.</p>

<p>I called it, her, in.</p>

<p>I’m no bunny humper but fur coats make little sense to me I don’t need the socio-economic, market differentiation explanation. Here’s an old woman, probably afraid to watch the evening news, yet wears the clothing equivalent of a sausage factory.</p>

<p>I operate my business on a sliding scale. I slid it to the right. I’ve been known to do pro-bono, but I didn’t think she’d need it. She didn’t.</p>

<p>“I’ve lost something.”</p>

<p>I keep my list of services vague. Boston’s a tough town and you never know when a treed cat will pay the heating bill.</p>

<p>“A ring, it’s somewhere in my house.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Miss—”</p>

<p>“Capshaw, Rosemary Capshaw.”</p>

<p>“I don’t do house cleaning. Perhaps you have an assistant?” Or a psychic. But from the looks of her she probably did; on retainer. A phrenologist too. I gave the scale another shove.</p>

<p>“No, it’s in my house. Somewhere in the walls.”</p>

<p>“You need a carpenter.” And a shrink. But she’d already have one of those too; maybe should up her dose.</p>

<p>“I had one but he couldn’t find it. He tore my house apart and still couldn’t find it. Then he gave me your number.”</p>

<p>I have to wonder about the people that recommend me. I probably photographed his wife cheating. Maybe roughed the guy up too. Value-addeds make customers for life.</p>

<p>“I’ll see what I can do.” My calendar, if I had a calendar, was empty; also why I don’t have a calendar.</p>

<p>Rosemary drove. I could have asked to bring along an elephant and it would have fit comfortably in the backseat; might have scuffed up the leather though.</p>

<p>Her house was large, but that was to be expected considering she needed somewhere to park the car. It was an old carriage house with a mansard roof. That sort of thing may have fooled the French, who taxed by the floor, but Yankee assayers are more clever. They call it historical architecture and increase the value. But I don’t think property taxes keep Rosemary up at night.</p>

<p>She had a nice place. Selling it would lead to quite the nice South Florida retirement. Nothing like my own apartment. Atlantic city has nothing on the Boston rental market: the odds are horrible and the house always wins. I rent the second floor of a triple-decker. Unless I experience a “life altering” event, I’m guaranteed to be out on my ass: carting my belongings down the street when the place goes condo, or in an ambulance when the owner firebombs it.</p>

<p>She showed me to the attic. Quite a carpenter she found; the place was ripped to shreds. To be expected if the guy recommended me. The floorboards along an entire wall was torn apart, down to the studs.</p>

<p>While we were driving over she explained the situation: priceless ring, slip of the hand, crack in the floor.</p>

<p>“So you’re sure this is exactly where it slipped.”</p>

<p>“Completely. I was right here.”</p>

<p>“What’s beneath this?”</p>

<p>“My parlor.”</p>

<p>The wood in this place was amazing, and I don’t just mean the floor. Moldings, doorframes, inset cabinetry was all perfect. Most times it’s easier just gut them rather than refinish. Replace priceless mahogany and cherry with spruce or pine. Spruce takes a good coat of paint but not much else. As for pine, when I was a baby I teethed on our furniture. Wouldn’t happen here though. Somebody probably sanded their family a new car working on this place and that car would still be out of my price range.</p>

<p>In the parlor the baseboards were completely torn up too, with obvious belief that the ring would have fallen down through the wall. No insulation: typical. Coldest winters in the country and nobody thinks to use a little fiberglass.</p>

<p>I knocked the wall. Carpenter was a dolt. New England houses are always interesting, and he apparently didn’t know this one’s particular peculiarity:</p>

<p>Hurricane brace; a solid beam running diagonally across the wall. From modern architectural standing such a thing is half over-engineering, half-diminished standards: buildings these days are mostly plastic wrap. That it comes from 3M rather than Stretch-Tite doesn’t make much of a difference.</p>

<p>I measured out the dimensions in my head, matching up where she dropped her ring in the attic above.</p>

<p>“Do you mind?”</p>

<p>Plaster walls: it takes a jackhammer to drive a nail into, but any flat, blunt object will bust them wide open. Like a fist.</p>

<p>There are few parts of my CV I enjoy more than my extensive knowledge of and experience in effectively hitting things. The wall gave way in a burst of gypsum and lead paint. Between the mangled wooden strips of plaster-backing, I spotted a glint of something.</p>

<p>I reached through the hole, gave my sliding scale one last tap, and retrieved her ring. Needless to say, she was satisfied. And cleaning up is never a part of my job description.</p>

<p>I’m very proud to be officially launching ** <a href="http://panlexicon.com">Panlexicon.com</a>: a unique thesaurus<strong>. Using intuitive **“tag clouds”</strong> to represent synonyms, <a href="http://panlexicon.com">Panlexicon</a> makes discovering the word you want quick, easy and explorational.</p>

<p>Panlexicon’s current functions allow you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>First</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.iucn-tftsg.org/?albino_farm">Albino Farm full</a></p>

<p>, perform a lookup on a single word and receive a weighted cloud of synonyms.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Second</strong>, view synonyms that overlap across multiple words either by entering the words manually, or clicking on words already in the cloud to further refine your search.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For example</strong>, performing a search on “ <a href="http://panlexicon.com/?query=cool">cool</a>” provides a wide variety of synonyms from “chilly”, to “unimpassioned”, to “groovy”. Refining the search using <a href="http://panlexicon.com/?query=cool,nifty">cool <em>and</em> nifty</a> provides more refined synonyms.</p>

<p>By varying the size of the typeface, like tag clouds do, the most relevant terms <strong>pop out at you</strong> allowing you to quickly scan through large lists of words. Also, because the algorithm is a little fuzzy, you may run across related words that provide better context.</p>

<p>Panlexicon was developed jointly with <a href="http://circuitous.org">Rebecca</a> who originally proposed the project and did much of the research on thesauri and helped develop the word relevance algorithms.</p>

<p>The word lists come from the <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/3202">Moby Thesaurus</a> as part of <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenburg’s</a> library of free electronic texts. <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> is used as a simple framework for core functions such as database abstraction and page callbacks and to simplify future feature developments. Google AdSense is activated on the site, but that is due more to curiosity over the interplay of contextual advertising and the word lists than on any current revenue model.</p>

          <p>Last week I attended NTEN’s 2007 <a href="http://nten.org/ntc">Nonprofit Technology Conference</a> and sat in on a wonderful session entitled <strong>Nonprofit Communications 2.0: Seven Steps to Transform Your Organization.</strong> Led by <a href="http://www.cctv.org/index.php?SiteAlias=cctv&amp;PageAlias=CCTV_Staff#LG">Lauren-Glenn Davitian</a> of the <a href="http://www.cctv.org/">CCTV Center for Media and Democracy</a>, the session provided a strong framework for nonprofits to better communicate in an increasingly networked society.</p>

<p>I am also very lucky to serve with Lauren-Glenn on the editorial board of the <a href="http://communitymediareview.org/">Community Media Review</a>.</p>

<p>The video itself is approximately 1 hour, 24 minutes long and worth every second, but I included my notes from the session below.</p>

<h3 id="the-seven-steps">The Seven Steps</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Assessment</strong>: Defining your goal (What behavior are you trying to change in undertaking a communications strategy?), audience (an explicit, targeted “who” and their values), evaluating your infrastructure (orthodoxies, structure, time, leadership)</li>
  <li><strong>Awareness</strong>: Start by searching <a href="http://nten.org">NTEN</a>, <a href="http://techsoup.org">TechSoup</a>, <a href="http://www.idealware.org/">Idealware</a>, etc. (Link Research)</li>
  <li><strong>Training</strong>: A discipline of doing things. How are stories told, infrastructure built and actions communicated to regular people?</li>
  <li><strong>Content Production</strong>: “The currency of the new world”</li>
  <li><strong>Technical Support</strong>: An example: how to know when to build and when to buy</li>
  <li><strong>Partnerships</strong>: Who is going to stand up for you?</li>
  <li><strong>Planning</strong>: What are the components that revolve around your goal?</li>

<p><em>I shot this video with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Casio-Exilim-EX-S600-Digital-Optical/dp/B000E158D4">Casio EX-S600</a>, which shoots full-frame (640 x 480) MPEG-4 video. With a two gigabyte SD Card it can shoot approximately an hour and a half of video at medium quality before its battery dies. The Casio’s AVI wrapper is incompatible with iMovie (or any Quicktime decoder), so I first used <a href="http://www.techspansion.com/visualhub/">VisualHub</a> to repackage the video as an MP4 before importing into iMovie to add titles. I exported from iMovie as DV and then converted that with VisualHub into MPEG-4. Compressed and at quarter-frame (320 x 240) the entire video was 105 MB. This time I uploaded to Google Video since <a href="http://blip.tv">Blip.tv</a> stalled out.</em></p>
