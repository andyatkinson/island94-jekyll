          <p>A girl was betrothed by her father to a man whom she had never met. Her mind shone with an uncommon light and she was ever seeking out tales of love: chaste and reckless, rich and unrequited.</p>

<p>Into her house she called the most upstanding matrons and the lowest whores, regal queens and barren slaves. To each she said, simply: “Tell me of the men you have loved.”</p>

<p>This intense interest worried her father. Though he had found a most suitable bridegroom for his dearly loved daughter, he feared such tales would influence her against any future husband.</p>

<p>She reassured him: “Father, please do not worry. I trust in you that I will live happily with whomever you have chosen for me. I seek these stories so that I may separate the qualities in him that are exceptional from those that are mundane. Knowing this, I can love him.”</p>

          <p>My friend and coworker <a href="http://circuitous.org/rebecca/">Rebecca</a> made an extensive list of things she’d like for her <a href="http://circuitous.org/rebecca/2006/12/12/birthday-list/">birthday</a>. I really like her rationale:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>my list is all about ‘you’ because I’m curious who will answer, what you will come up with, and because it will mean that on my birthday I’ll be thinking about people thinking about me, which is a cozy thing to think about.</p>

<p>I know a family of trees on a block along my jogging route in my neighborhood. Jamaica Plain is known to be full of trees, but usually the varieties are pretty well mixed. On this block though, a whole grove of Ginkgo trees grows, or as close to a grove as you can get in urban Boston.</p>

<p>The trees are all about 20 feet tall with rough gray bark. In the spring and summer they are deep green. In the Fall they all turn a self-conscious bright yellow, in contrast to the other trees’ reds and oranges.</p>

<p>One tree in the grove is set back off the street. It has a wound on its sunset side. The tree is also female, the only one, and is neighbor to the grove’s lone outsider: a juvenile Callery Pear that is always losing branches.</p>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>My pet project, <a href="http://meetamericorps.com">MeetAmeriCorps.com</a> has finally passed that development milestone that marks a “social network”: Buddylists. To be a little more haute, we’ve decided to call them “contact lists”, but the concept is the same: you can demarcate people who you like/know/want-to-be-on-your-contact-list.</p>

<p>Since I haven’t really been advertising it too heavily, Meet AmeriCorps <em>was</em> a directory–now it’s a “social network”–of AmeriCorps and AmeriCorps*VISTA volunteers who are either currently serving or alumni. It’s pretty neat stuff, doesn’t look to shabby and, disclosing I am the lead developer on the project, actually kind’ve useful.</p>

<p>We put together MeetAmeriCorps.com to fill what I see as a sorely lacking need. <a href="http://americorps.gov">AmeriCorps</a> and VISTA are essentially-governmental, national-service programs that mostly places full-time, stipended volunteers with community organizations. AmeriCorps speaks of itself as a “network” that is creating a “national service movement”. Unfortunately, it doesn’t have the capacity to truly achieve this because, in my opinion and experience, AmeriCorps and VISTA members generally <strong>do not</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>communicate with other members serving with other organizations (even organizations inside a single community)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>self-identify as AmeriCorps volunteers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>collaborate on developing resources and capacity</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>AmeriCorps and VISTA currently provide <a href="http://vistaolinc.net">some</a> <a href="http://nationalserviceresources.org/resources/listservs/index.php">tools</a> and <a href="http://nationalserviceresources.org">resources</a> to achieve #3, but I believe that #3 cannot be achieved with volunteers being able to effectively communicate and identify themselves as AmeriCorps both to each other and the outside world.</p>

<p>Meet AmeriCorps seeks to provide an easy-to-use tool for AmeriCorps members to meaningfully interact with one another both within service, and outside of it. I hope this will improve the experience of being an AmeriCorps or VISTA volunteer and contribute towards creating a true network and movement.</p>
