<p>I was down in Back Bay today and snapped this picture of the subway map.</p>

<p>These new maps were put up just a few months ago and as you can see, quite a number of people have placed their finger on the map and said “We’re here…”</p>

<p>Jessica sings in the <em>Coolidge Corner Community Chorus</em>, a non-denominational choir. They were out for First Light, a seasonal celebration where, as far as I can tell, musicians all over Coolidge Corner display their musical wares.</p>

<p>I work in Lowell, MA, an old mill city criss-crossed with canals. In New England, the Fall leaves are at first beautiful on the trees, then gross as they litter the sidewalks, roads, and as I found out, waterways as well. When I first saw this canal I thought there had been a chemical spill. Upon closer inspection, I saw that it was just Autumn leaves.</p>

<p>This is a short video that I shot of my neighbor’s pool. Using my little Casio digicam and a camera mount consisting of a box of Trader Joe’s Green Tea, I taped some of the gusty winds we were getting today as they moved leaves around in the pool.</p>

<p>The original tape was 27 minutes that I then cut frames from (by about a factor of 50) to give a time lapse effect. If you watch the bottom right of the screen you can see the shadows shift as the sun moves overhead. I am not sure, but there is a quick round white reflection that moves across the pool that I think may be the moon.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

<p>At one time you would find Island 94, known as Crow’s Nest Island or Stack Island, on the Mississippi River, whose islands were numbered consecutively south from where the mouth of the Ohio fed into her muddy waters. This particular island was known as a haven for rogues, thieves and river pirates who would prey both on the commerce and towns of the river.</p>

<p>In the early morning hours of December 16, 1811, the island would disappear forever, disintegrating into the river as just one small result of one of the worst natural disasters to strike what is now the midwestern United states: the New Madrid earthquakes.</p>

<p>This series of earthquakes would continue for more than 6 months, causing the light alluvial soil of the Mississippi River Valley to roll like ocean waves and destroying much that had been built or settled. The quakes were seen at time as the wrath of God, an electrical disturbance of the earth or as the fulfillment of a prophesy by the Native American leader Tecumseh who, while soliciting support for Native American unity in reaction to U.S. land grabs and aggression, threatened a disagreeing tribe with this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I shall go to Detroit. When I arrive there, I will stamp my foot on the ground and shake down every house in Tuckhabatchee.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="apocryphal">Apocryphal</h3>

<p>I have always found the early history of North America to be fascinating. Not just the struggling nation of the United States and her nieghbors, but the individuals, heard of or not, who lived during the time. These were both the people seeking a better life, long before the encouragements of Horace Greely, and those hoping to maintain and regain what they had or had already lost.</p>

<p>After reading the most excellent book, <em>When the Mississippi River Ran Backwards</em> by Jay Feldman, an account and analysis of the New Madrid Earthquakes, I thought, Now there’s an idea for my blog.</p>

<p>The idea of Island 94 evokes in me a neo-Atlantean idea. Despite, or perhaps because of, my closest held beliefs in science and causation, I can never quite be sure that something has disappeared without knowing for sure where and why it’s gone.</p>

<p>I envision a place filled with dropped sewing needles, mismatched socks and my box turtle, Rex. A place somewhere in the backwaters where the inhabitants of Island 94 are still living and thieving (perhaps on Atlanteans and Roanokeans) unaware, or perhaps content, that everyone else believes them lost.</p>

<p>This website is a backwater of my own; a repository for my own thoughts and experiences threatened by the forward roll of life and time held in an imperfect memory.</p>
