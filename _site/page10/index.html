While in New York a few weekends ago I visited the <a href="http://www.solar1.org/">Solar Powered Arts Festival</a> at the encouragement of a local techy and all around good guy Jacob. He and the ever smiling Diana met me at Stuyvesant Cove Park on Sunday afternoon, both of them having used pedal power to get up there from Brooklyn; I took the metro. There was a lot of really cool artisans and builders out. From the friendly woman who paints <a href="bicyclepaintings.com">bicycle portraits</a> to the kooky guy setting alight aluminum and lye (the combination creates hydrogen gas) and giving away plans for sterling engines. A stage was powered entirely by solar panels where local musicians were jamming. Also, the Children’s Zoo had a couple of snakes and monarch butterflies out for people to touch and their keepers, of course, who you couldn’t. I had a good time photographing the two “structures” the organizers had built: the first built out of cardboard tubing, the other a pile of tires. The tubing was a mish mash of concrete-piling-forms connected together with “a couple thousand bolts”; this from the guy further reinforcing it further with nails pounded in by the side of his wrench “to fill time”. It was throwing some crazy shadows. The tires were just a bunch of tires piled up with plants in them; it was a nice juxtaposition of green and black.

After my <a href="http://island94.org/node/86&quot;&quot;">long walk</a> on Saturday I ended up in Harlem for a <a href="http://youthchannel.org">Youth Channel</a> blockparty hosted by <a href="http://mnn.org">Manhattan Neighborhood Network</a> (MNN), one of the largest (if not <em>the</em> largest) public access stations in the country. Youth Channel provides disadvantaged, low-income and minority youth with access to a quality media forum through which to express creativity, foster dialogue, and to encourage social and political participation. At the blockparty there were lots of food, music, fun and of course, cameras.

I go down to New York City to see my friend’s new apartment, and somehow get roped into teaching people how to videoblog. What a crazy weekend. Manhattan Neighborhood Network (MNN) hosted a videoblogging meet-and-greet in their studio on Saturday night as part of <a href="http://node101.org">Node101 Weekend</a>. There were lots of food, people and of course cameras. Many attendees were cable access producers who had never vlogged before. I showed them how easy it was to <a href="http://freevlog.org">shoot, edit, compress and upload</a>. Click on the tableau above, or <a href="http://node101mnn.blip.tv">here</a> to see what people were posting.

I spent the weekend in New York City. Saturday, having a free afternoon, I walked from 59th Street all the way up to 148th Street in Harlem. It took about four hours, but was a beautiful day and an awesome walk.</p>

Community technology is great. It is incredibly refreshing to be reminded on a daily basis that, as a developer and technologist, I don’t know crap about how everyday people view and use technology. Two weeks ago I was in Washington, DC for the CTCnet Conference. While there I helped John Lorance of <a href="http://www.compumentor.org/">CompuMentor</a> give a presentation on how Community Technology Centers and nonprofit orgaizations can use “Web 2.0” services and tools like <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>, <a href="http://wikipedia.org">wikis</a>, <a href="http://mappingaccess.com">mapping</a>, <em>et cetera</em>, to improve their programs and better fulfill their missions. At the end we opened the floor to questions and comments. An attendee stood up and said that he had always been worried that with computers and machines growing ever smarter and more powerful, one day they would overthrow mankind. <em>But</em>, after seeing these new Web 2.0 tools, he is relieved that humans will always stay one step ahead of the machines. <em>Hallelujah</em>. I made this drawing using <a href="http://inkscape.org">Inkscape</a>, an awesome open source illustration program.</p>
