  <p>The average PBS show on prime time now scores about a 1.4 Nielsen rating, or roughly what the wrestling show “Friday Night Smackdown” gets.
Probably the average reader of the NY Times doesn’t think much of Friday Night Smackdown (I don’t really), but it gets a pretty good following. So in my opinion, contrary to what I think this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/arts/television/17mcgr.html">editorial</a> is intending, that’s not a very damning statistic.</p>
