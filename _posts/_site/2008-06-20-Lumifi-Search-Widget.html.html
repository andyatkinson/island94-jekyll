<p>I’ve found the <a href="http://lumifi.com">Lumifi Search / Research Platform</a> useful at times, but it sometimes seems like a sledgehammer. They have a widget for just search that’s pretty useful. If I’m looking for specific things with a lot of noise (like “nonprofit culture”), it tends to give some interesting results.</p>

<p>Get the <a href="http://www.widgetbox.com/widget/lumifi">lumifi</a> widget and many other <a href="http://www.widgetbox.com/galleryhome/">great free widgets</a> at <a href="http://www.widgetbox.com">Widgetbox</a> !</p>

<p>They also have it as an <a href="http://www.lumifi.com/Widget.html">OSX Dashboard Widget</a>.</p>
