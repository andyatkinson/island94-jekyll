<blockquote>
  <p>I totally understand that this is a small example and that these techniques can feel like overkill for a problem of this size.  Perhaps they are; I wouldn’t resist if you insisted it were so.  However, there are bigger problems for which these techniques are the perfect solution and I rely on your ability to see the larger abstraction.  You can’t choose whether to use these techniques unless you know them and it’s much easier practice on a small example like this.</p>

<p>From the Chapter 1 of Robert Martin’s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code</a></em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consider this book a description of the <em>Object Mentor [the group of authors of this book] School of Clean Code</em>. The techniques and teachings within are the way that <em>we</em> practice <em>our</em> art. We are willing to claim that if you follow these teachings, you will enjoy the benefits that we have enjoyed, and you will learn to write code that is clean and proessional. But don’t make the mistake of thinking that we are somehow “right” in any absolute sense. There are other schools and other masters that have just as much claim to professionalism as we. It would behoove you to learn from them as well.</p>

  <p>Indeed, many of the recommendations in this book are controversial. You will probably not agree with all of them. You might violently disagree with some of them. That’s fine. We can’t claim final authority. On the other hand, the recommendations in this book are things that we have thought long and hard about. We have learned them through decades of experience and repeated trial and error. So Whether you agree or disagree, it would be a shame if you did not see, and respect, our point of view.</p>
