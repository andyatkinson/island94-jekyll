<p><a href="http://supermayor.io">Super Mayor Emanuel</a> is one of the goofier applications I’ve built at Code for America: <a href="http://supermayor.io"><strong>supermayor.io</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>Boring explanation:</strong> Using data from Chicago’s Open311 API the app lists, in near-realtime, service requests within the City of Chicago’s 311 system that have recently been created, updated or closed.</p>

<p><strong>Awesome explanation:</strong> The mayor runs through the streets of Chicago, leaping over newly-reported civic issues and collecting coins as those civic problems are fixed.</p>

<p>I really like this application, not only because of its visual style, but because it lets you engage with the 311 data in a completely novel way: aurally. Turn up those speakers and let the website run in the background for about 30 minutes. Spinies (new requests) come in waves, and coin blocks (updated/closed requests) are disappointingly rare. Sure, I could have just created a chart of statistics, but I think actually <em>experiencing</em> requests as they come in makes you think differently about both the people who submitted a request and the 311 operators and city staff who are receiving them (just think about what caused those restaurant complaints… or maybe don’t).</p>

<p>The application is built with Node.js, which fetches and caches 311 requests, and a Backbone-based web-app, communicating via socket.io, which manages all of interface and animation. The source is on <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/super-mayor">Github</a>.</p>
