Paul’s humor, optimism and vision have profoundly influenced me in the past two years I have known him.</p>

<p>Paul was an inspiration to me: in his design and art, his use of colors and contrast, his rediscovery of common (and uncommon) objects and his whimsy and delight in their placement. In our work Paul showed me how to stay sane in insane places and where to look for fun in the mundane. Most of all, Paul was a model for maintaining one’s sense of self in the most ego-reducing places.</p>

<p>Paul, you will be greatly missed and not forgotten.</p>
