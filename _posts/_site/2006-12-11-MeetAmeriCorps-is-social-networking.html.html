<p>My pet project, <a href="http://meetamericorps.com">MeetAmeriCorps.com</a> has finally passed that development milestone that marks a “social network”: Buddylists. To be a little more haute, we’ve decided to call them “contact lists”, but the concept is the same: you can demarcate people who you like/know/want-to-be-on-your-contact-list.</p>

<p>Since I haven’t really been advertising it too heavily, Meet AmeriCorps <em>was</em> a directory–now it’s a “social network”–of AmeriCorps and AmeriCorps*VISTA volunteers who are either currently serving or alumni. It’s pretty neat stuff, doesn’t look to shabby and, disclosing I am the lead developer on the project, actually kind’ve useful.</p>

<p>We put together MeetAmeriCorps.com to fill what I see as a sorely lacking need. <a href="http://americorps.gov">AmeriCorps</a> and VISTA are essentially-governmental, national-service programs that mostly places full-time, stipended volunteers with community organizations. AmeriCorps speaks of itself as a “network” that is creating a “national service movement”. Unfortunately, it doesn’t have the capacity to truly achieve this because, in my opinion and experience, AmeriCorps and VISTA members generally <strong>do not</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>communicate with other members serving with other organizations (even organizations inside a single community)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>self-identify as AmeriCorps volunteers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>collaborate on developing resources and capacity</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>AmeriCorps and VISTA currently provide <a href="http://vistaolinc.net">some</a> <a href="http://nationalserviceresources.org/resources/listservs/index.php">tools</a> and <a href="http://nationalserviceresources.org">resources</a> to achieve #3, but I believe that #3 cannot be achieved with volunteers being able to effectively communicate and identify themselves as AmeriCorps both to each other and the outside world.</p>

<p>Meet AmeriCorps seeks to provide an easy-to-use tool for AmeriCorps members to meaningfully interact with one another both within service, and outside of it. I hope this will improve the experience of being an AmeriCorps or VISTA volunteer and contribute towards creating a true network and movement.</p>
