  <p>Anyway, I’ve been thinking about an email app built on a principle of Objectivism. At the moment, my email client defaults to doing nothing, and I must intervene to create action (ie, write a reply).</p>

  <p>But if I had an Objectivist email app, it would automatically respond to all emails with stock enabling and forceful replies after a period of (say) 15 minutes, and I would have to intervene if I wanted it to not do that.</p>

<p>I shared it in Google Reader and Tom Wolf (who I’ve <a href="http://www.island94.org/2009/10/teaching-through-breakage/">quoted before</a>) replied:</p>

  <p>This is a neat way to think about building applications. Rather than starting from “let’s solve a problem”, start from “given this solution, how should it behave assuming I hold X as my primary belief framework?” I’m not sure it’s a <em>practical</em> way to build apps for the masses, but it’s pretty cool nonetheless :)</p>
