<p>Just saw this <a href="http://trust.cse.ucsc.edu/">demo</a> of an algorithm that rates the trustworthiness of Wikipedia articles. It computes the “trust” of authors by how long their edits stick around, then applies that to articles. (via <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/it/07/08/31/0259224.shtml">Slashdot</a>)</p>

<p>I wonder how it works on entries that are intentionally misleading, like the entry on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordianism">Discordianism</a>.</p>
