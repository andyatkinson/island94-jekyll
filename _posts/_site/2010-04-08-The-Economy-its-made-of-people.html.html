<p>William Bloom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…people do not work and create the economy because they want to support the economy. They create and relate—and this in turn, creates the economy.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From David Boyle’s _The Little Money Book. _His commentary on the quote above: “So don’t be taken in by economists. We created the economy around us, and if we want to change it, we can do just that.”</p>
