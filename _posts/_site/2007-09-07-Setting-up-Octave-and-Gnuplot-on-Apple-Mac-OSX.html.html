<p>I just started auditing a Mathematical Models in Biology class and Matlab is one of the requirements. I had relatively good experience with the free, open source alternative, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">Octave</a> back in college, but then I was running Linux, not OSX. It took me about an hour to figure out how to set it up (I was a little worried for a bit).</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Download the Octave binary for OSX from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/octave/files/Octave%20MacOSX%20Binary/2009-10-03%20binary%20of%20Octave%203.2.3/">Octaveforge</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Install Octave and Gnuplot (in the extras folder). I just dragged them to /Applications (X11 is required for Gnuplot—should be found on OSX install disk)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are using OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard) or 10.5.8+ you may need to perform some additional steps <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/octave/files//Octave%20MacOSX%20Binary/2009-10-03%20binary%20of%20Octave%203.2.3/README_OSX1065.txt/view">outlined here</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set the environment variable for gnuplot (Octave is supposed to do this automatically, but it didn’t for me): `</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>sudo ln -s /Applications/GnuPlot.app/Contents/Resources/bin/gnuplot /usr/bin/gnuplot</p>

<p>`</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Download and install (again in /Applications) <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/aquaterm/">Aquaterm</a> which will actually render the gnuplot graphs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within Gnuplot, set the renderer: “terminal aqua”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Try it out in Octave (I had to restart Octave and Gnuplot to get it all to work): `</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>x = linspace(-pi, pi, 100);</p>

<p>y = sin(x);</p>

<p>plot(x, y);</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>Thank you: <a href="http://hpc.sourceforge.net/">High Performance Computing for Mac OS X</a>, <a href="http://wiki.octave.org/wiki.pl?MacOSXIntegration">the Octave Wiki</a> and Google for helping me find what I needed.</p>

<p><em><strong>Update (January 24, 2010):</strong> updated the link in step #1 to the latest version of Octave. Added an additional step described by <a href="http://www.island94.org/2007/09/setting-up-octave-and-gnuplot-on-osx/#comment-80303">Zack in the comment</a>s (thanks!)</em></p>
