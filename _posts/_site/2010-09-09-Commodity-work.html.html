<p>From the <a href="http://www.dos.state.ny.us/info/constitution.htm">New York State Constitution</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Article 1, Section 17. Labor of human beings is not a commodity nor an article of commerce and shall never be so considered or construed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a result of this  <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/july-dec10/mott_09-06.html"><em>Newshour</em> report on the Mott’s worker strike</a>: “Workers who feel they’re now being treated as a commodity in a land of excess labor.”</p>
