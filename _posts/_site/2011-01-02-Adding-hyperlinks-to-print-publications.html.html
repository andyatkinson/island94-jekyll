<p>I am very impressed with how Marcus du Sautoy’s <em>The Number Mysteries</em> integrates hyperlinks into the book using URL shorteners and QR codes (above). Contrast that with Dan Cederholm’s <em>Handcrafted CSS _(which is still an excellent book)</em>. _The latter was published August 2009, the former August 2010.</p>
