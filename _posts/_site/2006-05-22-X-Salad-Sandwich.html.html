<p>*Alternate Title:* May I? You Mayo.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if it’s a Lowell thing, a New England thing, or a Ben-is-woefully-ignorant thing, but there has been some major innovation in terms of “salad.”</p>

<p>I put salad in quotes because this is not your leafy green, or even weedy weird, salad with the pine nuts, raisins if you’re lucky, and maybe a little balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil to round it out.</p>

<p>No, dear reader, this is the meat meet mayo abomination that, having taken hold in our church socials, is fattening it’s way towards mainstream America. So far I count:</p>

<h1 id="egg-salad-the-classic-cholestrol-coronator">Egg Salad (The classic cholestrol coronator)</h1>

<h1 id="tuna-salad-a-little-fishy">Tuna Salad (A little fishy)</h1>

<h1 id="seafood-salad-its-not-tuna-salad">Seafood Salad (It’s not tuna salad)</h1>

<h1 id="chicken-salad-poor-bird">Chicken Salad (Poor bird)</h1>

<h1 id="ham-salad-the-even-whiter-meat">Ham Salad (The even whiter meat)</h1>

<p>Only God knows what substance they Mayonaise Advisory Council will think of adding next.</p>
