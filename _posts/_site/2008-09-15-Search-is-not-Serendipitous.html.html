<p>Erin McKean makes the point in a <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/erin_mckean_redefines_the_dictionary.html">TED talk</a> that, unlike paper dictionaries, online dictionary searches do not provide serendipity: finding something you didn’t know you were looking for.</p>

<p>I take this many ways:</p>

<p>True, but…</p>

<p>How many people regularly flip a dictionary?</p>

<p>How exact is search?</p>

<p>How many people just type the word into Google (which, because internet search sucks, is quite serendipitous).</p>
