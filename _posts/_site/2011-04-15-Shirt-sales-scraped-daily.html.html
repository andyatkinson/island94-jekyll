<p>I am remiss to finally get around to blogging <a href="http://dayoftheshirt.com">Day of the Shirt</a>, which I launched back in October, 2010. It’s a straightforward and (hopefully) aesthetically-pleasing t-shirt aggregator.</p>

<p>What’s nifty about Day of the Shirt is that it’s built entirely with  <a href="http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/">PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser</a>. And when I say entirely, I mean <em>entirely</em>: there is no database backend, everything is scraped, including itself. Day of the Shirt…</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>scrapes t-shirt vendors to get names, links and thumbnails (which are cropped and cached);</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>scrapes, parses and rewrites its own DOM when new shirts are added (we’re serving completely static html);</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and scrapes itself to compose its <a href="http://twitter.com/dayoftheshirt">daily tweets</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>That last step is a little extravagant, but I wanted to separate the early-morning website update from the mid-morning tweeting—otherwise only the early birds would ever see the tweet. Of course, I re-used the <a href="http://www.island94.org/2010/08/p-np-and-panlexicon/">tweet-composing algorithm</a> from <a href="http://panlexicon.com">Panlexicon</a>.</p>

<p>Now the unfortunate part of this project was that I did a fair amount of competition research prior to building this website—but it wasn’t until about a week after I launched that I discovered an equivalent service: <a href="http://www.teemagnet.com/">Tee Magnet</a>. <em>C’est la vie.</em></p>
