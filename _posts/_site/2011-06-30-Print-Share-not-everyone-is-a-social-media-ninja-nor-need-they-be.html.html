<p>Today is the deadline for DonorsChoose’s <a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/hacking-education">Hacking Education Contest</a>, and fortunately I have completed and submitted  <a href="http://printandshare.org">Print and Share</a> (with no small effort by <a href="http://b.illbrown.com">Billy</a> on the design). I previously wrote about the <a href="http://www.island94.org/2011/06/data-driven-content-first-design/">details</a>.</p>

<p>Billy wrote my favorite part of the front-page copy: “Not everyone is a social media ninja.”</p>

<p>There is also a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWnwdAc2D2k">awkward screencast</a> by yours truly. “This is a great” indeed.</p>
