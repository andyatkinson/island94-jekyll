<p>This morning, coming home from my gym I went down into the Chinatown T-stop ( <a href="/node/9">here</a>). For the past few months, the escalator has been out of service and over that period become increasingly dismantled. In my investigation of this I would find I had become (booming voice) <em>a defender of democracy-ocracy-cracy</em>.</p>

<p>I find most mechanical things neato, especially when large, dirty and taken apart. Due to this, I happily pulled out my camera and began taking a few pictures of the escalator husk because, hey, why not. Little did I know that I could be abetting… <em>a terrorist</em>.</p>

<p>Fortunately for myself and my nation, the T attendant came out of her box and asked, “Are you supposed to be doing that?”</p>

<p>Feeling a bit like Galileo, I hesitatingly replied, “Umm, no.”</p>

<p>“You can’t be taking pictures of that. There are terrorists and we need to protect the station. You will have to delete those pictures”</p>

<p>Rather than point out that terrorists could still just as easily take the elevator if they were unable or unwilling to take the stairs, I dutifully complied-they were dark and blurry anyway-thus cementing my place as a <em>defender of democracy-ocracy-cracy</em>.</p>

<p>Looking back on those times, I feel fortunate that I was dressed as my alter ego, <em>average white guy</em>, or else the my experience could have been, in the name of freedom, drastically different.</p>

<p>Despite my lack of new T photos, as a protector of all things American, I feel it’s my civic duty to post a picture from the archive. She’s proud; and what woman wouldn’t be to date a <em>defender of democracy-ocracy-cracy</em>.</p>
