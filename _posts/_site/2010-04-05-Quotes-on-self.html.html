<p><em>Brooklyn Follies</em> by Paul Auster:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All men contain several men inside them, and most of us bounce from one self to another without ever knowing who we are. Up one day and down the next; morose and silent in the morning, laughing and cracking jokes at night. Harry had been low when he talked to Tom, but now that his business venture was in the works, he was flying high with me.</p>
