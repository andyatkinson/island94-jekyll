<p>I’ve already posted the <a href="http://www.island94.org/2008/10/popco-cake-recipe/">cake recipe</a> from <em>PopCo</em>—a great novel by Alice Butler—so here another part of the back matter: a table of the frequency of occurrence of letters in English from Fletcher Pratt’s S_ecret and Urgent: the story of codes and ciphers_, Blue Ribbon Books, 1939. To be fair, the table above is actually from the only place I could find it on the internet: a 1997 patent for a <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=WDsaAAAAEBAJ">chordic keyboard</a> who cites “Pratt Fetcher”. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fletcher_Pratt">Fletcher Pratt</a> also established a dining club upon which Asimov’s <em>Black Widowers</em> series was based. <strong>Update</strong>: Apparently the numbers above are different than what was published in <em>PopCo:</em> <img src="2010-03-04-Frequency-of-occurrence-of-letters-in-English/popco-frequency-of-letters-in-english.png" alt="" title="popco-frequency of letters in english" /></p>
