<p><a href="2010-08-31-Fondly-remembered-experiments-in-minimal-webdesign/pantextual-11.png"> <img src="2010-08-31-Fondly-remembered-experiments-in-minimal-webdesign/pantextual-11-500x356.png" alt="" title="pantextual-1" /> </a>Tomorrow is launch day for a blog aggregator website I worked on, but because I can’t write about that <em>just yet</em> I thought I’d write about a website whose development has influenced a lot of my approach to minimal webdesign: <a href="http://pantextual.com">Pantextual.com</a></p>

<p>(Few things ever die on the Internet, but Pantextual is definitely past its prime and has aged poorly as functions have been disabled to thwart spammers. Be that may…)</p>

<p>Pantextual was a micro-blogging experiment developed by <a href="http://circuitous.org">Rebecca White</a> and me in 2006; before we were completely sure we wanted to blog <a href="http://twitter.com/pantextual">via text message</a>. As an experiment, our intent was more of exploration than refinement—and refining with Drupal 5RC would have taken all the fun out of it. Our about page read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes even a little bit is too much.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But what if it was really beautiful, interesting and fun?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then you might not notice all the other irritations of life so much.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perhaps you might enjoy it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our goal was to fit as much content into a square box as possible and yet still make it a pleasure to read and an invitation to explore.</p>

<p>There was the obvious: nice typography (and Rebecca is to thank for the lovely ligature in the logo); gracefully overflowing if the content wouldn’t fit (you never know); not overwhelming the reader with content, even if it’s brief; and being playful: short content tends to be pithy content and we wanted a functional design to match.</p>

<p>The biggest problem by far was metadata. We wanted to stick with the standard conventions: date, author, categories, comments; we needed to find a place to put them and where we put them would determine if they were meaningful. Categories were the most fun to explore.</p>

<p>On Pantexual, we put categories inline, creating a custom syntax for tagging words as categories within the content itself. We also only displayed those words <em>as</em> categories if there was more than 1 post with that category. As the website filled in, we would place other content related through the categories next to the post itself, inviting exploration.</p>

<p>All in all, we did pretty good with a 400 pixel square box… maybe we should resuscitate it.</p>
