<p>My roommate (a teacher) left open this week’s <em>Newsweek</em> with a movie review of the French film, _ <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/182529">The Class</a>,_ that began with this quote, tattooed on one of the students and dubiously attributed to the Qu’ran:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If your words are less important than silence, keep quiet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which sounds suspiciously similar to the Buddhist quote:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do not speak—unless it improves on <em>silence</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trying to google through Christian quotations, I found little in the way of direct quotations, though lots of <a href="http://www.therealpresence.org/chapel/howtoflw.htm">interpretation</a>. </p>

<p>As a contemporary quote, I like <a href="http://www.cloudcult.com/">Cloud Cult</a>’s “The Deaf Girls Song”, off of _ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Meaning-8-Cloud-Cult/dp/B000NQR7RK">The Meaning of 8</a>_:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Did you hear about the deaf girl
The one whose song’s gone number one
Three minutes of silence on the radio
It’s the best damn gift for everyone</p>
