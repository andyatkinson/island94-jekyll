<p>Regular readers of this blog are aware that posts rarely reference the present, let along the contemporary. But on <a href="http://dayoftheshirt.com">Day of the Shirt</a>, I felt compunction: a daily t-shirt aggregator is nothing but contemporary—it’s a 1-page website. So I took down Day of the Shirt today to protest SOPA/PIPA legislation.</p>
