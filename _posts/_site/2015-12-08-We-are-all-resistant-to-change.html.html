<p>Came across this quote from John Kenneth Galbraith in a presentation by L. Carson of the University of Sydney about <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/ab/faculty_review/docs/strategic_questioning.pdf">Strategic Questioning (pdf)</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Faced with the choice between changing oneâ€™s mind and proving that there is no need to do so, almost everyone gets busy on the proof.</p>
