<p>My friend Thomas posted a status message to Facebook “wonders why Republicans hate America?”. This is where I’m at:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Define your terms! :-) By “America” do you mean?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>a pluralist society striving for a more representative government and greater civil liberties</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>a consensus society seeking a return to a more stable civic life built upon firm social and ethical principles</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>a geo-political demarcation for a group of people equally as unexceptional as everyone else.</li>
</ol>
