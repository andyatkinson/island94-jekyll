<p>One of my favorite haunts in Boston is Delux in the South End—mostly because a successive series of my friends have worked there.</p>

<p>One of their best dishes is the Quesadillas, which are made so in part by the salsa. I’ve been working to deconstruct it, so this is what I think is in it:</p>

<p>(this isn’t proportional)</p>

<p>Apple (seems like something red, maybe a macintosh)
Red Pepper
Yellow Pepper
Red onion
Yellow Onion (maybe)
Jalapeno
Pineapple juice (like a tiny splash, maybe)</p>

<p>It’s all chopped up into maybe 1/4 chunks and amazing</p>
