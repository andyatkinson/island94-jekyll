<p>Two weeks ago I launched a new website at <a href="http://brompt.com" title="a blog reminder service">Brompt.com</a>. It’s a web-based service for unreliable bloggers (like myself) that sends you an email if you haven’t posted to your blog in a while. It’s sort’ve like <a href="http://www.hassleme.co.uk/">HassleMe</a> except Brompt actively scans your blogs RSS feed to only send reminders when you’re lax (as opposed to just sending you a reminder every so often).</p>

<p>It’s very practical, but I also think Brompt is really interesting conceptually too. Everyone talks about RSS as just a means to aggregating <em>content</em>, but there is so much other interesting metadata in an RSS feed too.</p>

<p>Right now the site is just the barebones service, but I’m planning on adding some statistics and such so you can track your unreliability. It’s a fun project with a lot of possibilities.</p>
