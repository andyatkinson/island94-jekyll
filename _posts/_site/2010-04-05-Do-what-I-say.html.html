<p>Peter Klausler’s <a href="http://klausler.com/cargo.html">”</a>** <a href="http://klausler.com/cargo.html">Principles of the American Cargo Cult”</a> is one of my favorite statements (even more when applied to the idea of “best practices”).**</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>II. Causality is selectable</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>** All interconnection is apparent**</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Otherwise, complicated explanations would be necessary.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The end supports the explanation of the means</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>A successful person’s explanation of the means of his success is highly credible by the very fact of his success.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>** You can succeed by emulating the purported behavior of successful people**</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the key to the cargo cult. To enjoy the success of another, just mimic the rituals he claims to follow.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your idol gets the blame if things don’t work out, not you.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>You have a right to your share</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You get to define your share.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your share is the least you will accept without crying injustice.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Celebrate getting more than your share.</p>
</blockquote>
