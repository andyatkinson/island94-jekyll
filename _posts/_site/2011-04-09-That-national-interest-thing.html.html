<p>Iâ€™m still parsing through H.R.1363, the $38 billion appropriations bill passed late last night, but <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h1363/text?version=eh&amp;nid=t0:eh:361">this is generally representative</a> of the sausage trading to pay Paul approach:</p>

<blockquote>

In addition to the amounts appropriated or otherwise made available elsewhere in this Act, $65,200,000 is hereby appropriated to the Department of Defense: <em>Provided</em>, That upon the determination of the Secretary of Defense that it shall serve the national interest, he shall make grants in the amounts specified as follows: $20,000,000 to the United Service Organizations; $24,000,000 to the Red Cross; $1,200,000 to the Special Olympics; and $20,000,000 to the Youth Mentoring Grants Program: <em>Provided further</em>, That funds available in this section for the Youth Mentoring Grants Program may be available for transfer to the Department of Justice Youth Mentoring Grants Program.</p>
