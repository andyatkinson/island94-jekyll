<p>Since I just posted about how <a href="http://www.island94.org/2009/10/social-work-is-womens-work-so-we-dont-care/">social roles affect social values</a>, here’s a scenario we recently had in my Critical Thinking class.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A man and his son are involved in a car crash. The father dies on the scene and the son is rushed to hospital. On arrival the surgeon on duty says “I can’t operate on this boy, he is my son!” How is this possible?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Contextualizing it kind’ve kills the question.</p>
