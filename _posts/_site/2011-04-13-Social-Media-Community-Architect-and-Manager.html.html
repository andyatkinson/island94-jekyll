<p>Exploring the recesses of my email I came across some bad ideas I gave to a good friend, neighbor and excellent “Social Media Community Architect and Manager” as we were exploring possible resume headers for him:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I were to take the best amalgamation of words, I would go with “Social Media Community Architect and Manager”—which is somewhat awkward. I think you want the words:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>social (which is the buzzword of online social networking);</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>community (which is both online and offline and has a certain fuzziness to it); and</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>something that describes the process of creation… and management.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would shy clear of the word technology… “media” definitely has more hotness right now. Maybe “Social Media and Community Architect”.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>What about “Social Media and Community Entrepreneur” (everyone loves an Entrepreneur and I would say you qualify more than anyone I know… though it is somewhat heartless)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I went through my contacts on LinkedIn and picked out some words/phrases they use to describe themselves:</p>

<p>I think he went with something sensible like “Community Alchemist”.</p>
