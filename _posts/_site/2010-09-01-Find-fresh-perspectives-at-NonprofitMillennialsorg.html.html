<p>Myself and the <a href="http://nonprofitmillennials.org">Nonprofit Millennial Blogger Alliance</a> are proud to announce the launch of a new website: <a href="http://nonprofitmillennials.org">NonprofitMillennials.org</a>: “We blog about the millennial generation and nonprofits!”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Nonprofit Millennial Blogger Alliance is made up of young writers collectively bringing important issues about the nonprofit sector to the forefront. While each of us looks at the sector from a different perspective we share the view that millennials offer something valuable to nonprofits.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By sharing our knowledge and experiences from within Generation Y we can help prepare the next generation—and engage current generations—in addressing the pressing issues that continue to shape the nonprofit sector and the world</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The website aggregates posts from all members of the alliance in one place, making it easy to find a fresh article, subscribe to <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/npmillennials">everyone’s RSS feed</a> all in one place, or easily find us on Twitter ( <a href="http://twitter.com/npmillennials">@npmillennials</a>) where new articles are posted too.</p>

<p>I led the technical development and design on the website and am very proud of the outcome. The concept for a central aggregating website had been batted around for several months and I was able to take the lead as closer. We wanted a straightforward website that would highlight but not overshadow the writings of individual bloggers. It’s built on Wordpress, and posts are aggregated via the <a href="http://feedwordpress.radgeek.com/">FeedWordPress</a> plugin (which does an awesome job linking all posts back to their original author’s website, not ours!). Because the main focus is on our authors, not their content, there is a little <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/query-post-to-show-one-post-per-author">secret sauce</a> holding it all together.</p>

<p>So if you’re a millennial blogger writing about social change or the nonprofit sector, please consider <a href="http://nonprofitmillennials.org/#contact">joining us</a>. And don’t forget that “millennial” has 2 N’s (I do, all the time).</p>
