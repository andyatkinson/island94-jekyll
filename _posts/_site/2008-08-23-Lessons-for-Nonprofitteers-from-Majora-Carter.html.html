<p>This is more notes from last weekend’s Craigslist Foundation’s <a href="http://craigslistfoundation.org/index.php?page=ny2008">Nonprofit Bootcamp</a>.</p>

<p>Majora Carter, founder of Sustainable South Bronx, gave the afternoon keynote (I think the afternoon speech of a conference should be called a plenary). She spoke from experience in designing socially and ecologically sustainable projects. I think she covered some good points in her speech, but overall I felt like she was pitching to investors more than having an intimate discussion with peers—the latter being a tone I think Nancy Lublin nailed at last year’s Bootcamp ( <a href="http://craigslistfoundation.org/index.php?page=Keynotes">audio</a>; my <a href="http://island94.org/opinion-nonprofits">notes</a>). Also, I felt that her points were somewhat antagonistic (though perhaps reasonably so) but left out a sense of reality-check: yeah, you’re pissing off The Man, but does that mean that you’re changing society, or just being a nuisance?</p>
