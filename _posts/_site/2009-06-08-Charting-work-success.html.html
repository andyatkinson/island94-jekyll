<p>This venn diagram on <a href="http://whatconsumesme.com/2009/what-im-writing/how-to-be-happy-in-business-venn-diagram/">How to be Happy in Business</a> from Bud Caddell is making the rounds, and remember-worthy enough for me to post it here: <img src="2009-06-08-Charting-work-success/how-to-be-happy-in-business-venn-500x500.png" alt="how-to-be-happy-in-business-venn" title="how-to-be-happy-in-business-venn" /></p>

<p>Pair that with the other useful chart I like, Stephen Covey’s Time Management Matrix (or Urgent/Important Matrix)—this one from <a href="http://www.awakeblogger.com/2008/07/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people-1-private-victory/">AwakeBlogger</a> :</p>
