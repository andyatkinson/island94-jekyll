<p>Last weekend I visited Hudson, NY for the <a href="http://www.prometheusradio.org/">Prometheus Radio Project</a>â€™s first <a href="http://www.wgxc.org/">full-power radio barnraising</a>. I spent Saturday morning volunteering in the kitchen: despite all of the consensus-process workshops offered at the barnraising, the kitchen ran as an autocracy. Lunch remained delicious.</p>
