<p>It’s a little late to write about, but I spent Labor Day weekend in Rhode Island.</p>

<p>It turns out that Rhode Island is the largest producer of turf grass in the North East: more than 4,000 acres of turf. That’s a lot of sod.</p>

<p>It rained all day Sunday, so there was nothing else to do but take pictures of delicious wine grapes and eat them too.</p>
