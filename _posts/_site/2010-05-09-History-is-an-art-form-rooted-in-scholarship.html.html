<p>A personal statement from a Public History grad student (taken from their Facebook Page):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am interested in using history as an instrument for social change; history with a pragmatic purpose. The power of the past can be used to engage the present in ways to fight corruption, aristocracy, inequalities, racial/gender divides, and other forms of oppression and exploitation. I believe history is an art form rooted in scholarship.</p>
