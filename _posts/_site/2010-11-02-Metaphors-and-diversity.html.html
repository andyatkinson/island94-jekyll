<p>Interactions between people with diverse backgrounds leads to richer and more effective experiences.</p>

<p>About two months ago I attended the <a href="http://boston2010.140conf.com/schedule">140 Character Conference in Boston</a>. Mostly it was a bunch of white guys using phrases like “filter disintermediation”. Fortunately there was a woman who described the need to “midwife” a process, and a crazy old guy (that <em>is</em> what I wrote in my notebook—though he probably made the most sense) who described the educational system as “constipated”. They were the highlights—and pretty much all I remember too.</p>
