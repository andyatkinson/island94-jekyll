<p>A <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bensheldon/1306195094/">photo</a> I took in the halls of UMass Boston was featured in a _Wired Magazine _(well, on the website) in “ <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/09/deathstench/">Universal ‘Death Stench’ Repels Bugs of All Types</a>”.</p>

  <p><em>Image: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bensheldon/1306195094/">Flickr/bensheldon</a>. Note: This photo was chosen from a disturbingly <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/show/?q=dead+cockroach">large volume</a> of dead cockroach images on Flickr.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a tiny bit of controversy though: I was made aware the photo was being used when a <a href="http://www.tomtwigg.com/">good samaritan</a> emailed the author saying <em>Wired</em> had not respected the Creative Commons Attribution–<strong>Non-Commercial</strong></p>

<p>–Share-Alike license under which the image had been posted to Flickr. We’re currently awaiting a response from the article’s editor.</p>
