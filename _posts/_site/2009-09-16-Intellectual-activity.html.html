  <p>Only those who have power, for example, can define what is correct or incorrect. Only those who have power can decide what constitutes intellectualism.

I am auditing a class this semester on Quantitative Reasoning with Prof. Marilyn Frankenstein offered through the College of Public and Community Service at Umass Boston. The above quote was mentioned in our first class and taken from <em>Literacy: Reading the World &amp; The Word</em> by Paulo Freire and Donaldo Macedo (who is also on the UMass Boston faculty).

That’s because so much socializing takes place online, and it almost always involves text. Of all the writing that the Stanford students did, a stunning 38 percent of it took place out of the classroom—life writing, as Lunsford calls it. Those Twitter updates and lists of 25 things about yourself add up.</p>
